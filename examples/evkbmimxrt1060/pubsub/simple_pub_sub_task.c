/*
 * This file demonstrates task which use the MQTT agent API
 * to send unique MQTT payloads to unique topics over the same MQTT connection
 * to the same MQTT agent.  Some tasks use QoS0 and others QoS1.
 *
 * vSimpleSubscribePublishTask() subscribes to a topic then periodically publishes a message to the same
 * topic to which it has subscribed.  The command context sent to
 * MQTTAgent_Publish() contains a unique number that is sent back to the task
 * as a task notification from the callback function that executes when the
 * PUBLISH operation is acknowledged (or just sent in the case of QoS 0).  The
 * task checks the number it receives from the callback equals the number it
 * previously set in the command context before printing out either a success
 * or failure message.
