 Platform Security Architecture
=================================================

The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) by ARM is a holistic set 
of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware 
architecture specifications, and an open source firmware 
reference implementation.

ARMmbed provides an interface for PSA APIs as a part of its mbed-crypto 
project. Also, it supports SE driver interface which allows the user to 
use its own implementation for PSA cryptographic functions. This is useful 
for integrating Secure Element with mbed-crypto provided PSA interface. 

For details on PSA specification, refer to `ARMmbed PSA Specification`_.

PSA SE Driver Interface
=================================================

The SE Driver interface allows the user to register Secure Element drivers 
for various cryptographic operations. It is not necessary that one driver 
should offer all cryptographic functionalities, we can register up to 4 drivers 
which may offer different functionalities. 

Cryptographic APIs are split in to the following :

- SE_KEY_MANAGEMENT - Key management APIs like import/generate/destroy
- SE_MAC - Mac operations
- SE_CIPHER - Symmetric encrypt/decrypt operations
- SE_AEAD - AEAD/GCM operations
- SE_ASYMMETRIC - Asymmetric sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt operations
- SE_KEY_DERIVATION - Key derivation operations

The driver may support any subset of cryptographic functionalities, mbed-crypto 
offers software fall-back for APIs unavailable from SE.


.. note:: For SE interface, currently only SE_KEY_MANAGEMENT APIs, and asymmetric sign and 
    asymmetric verify APIs are supported.


PSA Concepts
=================================================

**Lifetime**
    The lifetime of an object refers to its persistence. An object can 
    either be ``PERSISTENT`` or ``VOLATILE``. However, for SE based PSA 
    implementation, it refers to the module ID of SE Driver. Lifetime 
    identifies the scope of an object (where the object is stored and 
    which operations are available for it). This is used while performing 
    any operation on an object. We can use different lifetimes while 
    performing operations with the same object as long as different 
    drivers can access the object.

**Slot ID**
    This is a 64-bit ID indicating where the object is loaded in the library. 
    PSA offers a maximum of 31 slots, which indicates that at a time, a 
    maximum of 31 objects can be used for any operation. If an object is 
    not being used, the object handle can be closed to free the slot. Since 
    there is no concept of an object being loaded for SE, the Slot ID will 
    refer to the Key ID of the object. Any application will remain unaware 
    of Slot ID and this should be managed internally. PSA library should 
    use this value to refer to any object.

    For SSS based PSA implementation, we have a 1:1 mapping of Slot ID from 
    Key ID. 

    Also see :ref:`psa-alt-keyids`.

**Key ID**
    This is a 32-bit ID indicating the file name of the object which will be 
    stored on the file system. Apart from the actual object, PSA also maintains 
    an object file which will store metadata of the object such as policies and 
    supported algorithms. Before performing any operation, these values are validated. 
    The applications will use this value to refer to any object. 

    For SSS based PSA implementation, the contents of this file may also stored 
    on SE.

    Also see :ref:`psa-alt-keyids`.

**PSA Objects**
    -   **LIFETIME_FILE** - This is SE specific file which can contain SE(driver) specific 
        persistent data 

    -   **TRANSACTION_FILE** - This is a temporary file created at the time of any operation.
        It will be deleted after the operation. This is also used to continue a pending 
        operation if, in case, the system reboots.
    
    -   **OBJECT_FILE** - This file corresponds to any object we create inside the SE. It 
        will store data about policy, supported algorithms, etc.

        (keyID range is 0x20000000 - 0x2FFFFFFF)
    
    -   **OBJECT** - This is the actual object created inside the SE.

        (keyID range is 0x30000000 - 0x3FFFFFFF)

    For any provided Key ID, the most significant nibble is masked out. The effective Key ID is 
    28-bit long. Also see :ref:`psa-alt-keyids`.

    .. warning::
        This logic of managing KeyIDs of various PSA objects is temporary and 
        it will be changed in the future.


.. _psa-alt-keyids:

Managing KeyIDs
=================================================

Application can provide any keyID to be used with SE. 
This will be mapped directly (1:1) with the slotID.
For internal usage, it is mapped to a 28-bit ID, masking 
out the most significant nibble. Of all PSA objects, 
**lifetime file**, **transaction file** and **secure objects** 
will always be stored in secure element. The application 
has an option to choose the storage for object metadata 
files. 

Providing the mask ``#define PSA_ALT_ITS_SE_FLAG ((0x1) << 28)`` 
in the keyID will ensure that object file is stored 
in secure element. If this flag is not set, object file 
will be stored in flash memory.

Flash storage currently has support to store only up to 
8 object files.

.. _psa-alt-building:

Building PSA for TrustZone
=================================================

PSA library is intended to run in ARM TrustZone. All examples will run in normal 
world and link to PSA library to perform cryptographic operations. Build the library 
for TrustZone with the following CMake configurations:

- ``Host=lpcxpresso55s_s``

- ``HostCrypto=MBEDCRYPTO``

- ``RTOS=Default``

- ``SMCOM=T1oI2C``

- ``PROJECT=PSA_ALT``
